## Why I Built This

When I first started building RESTful APIs, I focused mostly on getting the endpoints to work. But soon I realized that without **security**, itâ€™s not production-ready. I needed to figure out:

- How to protect routes
- How to authenticate users
- How to manage user sessions in a stateless way

So I decided to dive into **OAuth 2.0**, **JWTs (JSON Web Tokens)**, and **Spring Security** to build a secure API backend from scratch.

---

## Step 1 â€“ Designing the REST API

I kept it simple:

- `POST /register` â€“ Sign up a new user
- `POST /login` â€“ Log in and get a JWT
- `GET /profile` â€“ Protected route for authenticated users only

I used **Java + Spring Boot**, and exposed these as REST endpoints using Spring MVC.

---

## Step 2 â€“ Registering and Logging In Users

For registration, I just saved user data in a MySQL database. But for login, I needed to **generate a secure token**.

Thatâ€™s where **JWTs** came in.

Once the user logs in with email & password, I generate a JWT that looks like this:

```json
{
  "sub": "kush.kumar@example.com",
  "iat": 1680000000,
  "exp": 1680003600,
  "roles": ["USER"]
}
```

Itâ€™s signed using a secret key and sent back to the client. The client includes it in every future request using the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.

---

## Step 3 â€“ Securing Endpoints with OAuth 2.0 + JWT

I used Spring Securityâ€™s support for **JWT-based filters** to verify every request. When a token is present:

- I extract the username and roles
- I skip the login process
- I set the `SecurityContextHolder` with the authenticated user

Hereâ€™s what it looks like in code:

```java
@Override
protected void doFilterInternal(HttpServletRequest request,
                                HttpServletResponse response,
                                FilterChain filterChain) throws ServletException, IOException {

    String authHeader = request.getHeader("Authorization");

    if (authHeader != null && authHeader.startsWith("Bearer ")) {
        String token = authHeader.substring(7);
        String email = jwtService.extractUsername(token);

        if (email != null && SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication() == null) {
            UserDetails userDetails = userService.loadUserByUsername(email);

            if (jwtService.isTokenValid(token, userDetails)) {
                UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken authToken =
                    new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(userDetails, null, userDetails.getAuthorities());

                SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(authToken);
            }
        }
    }

    filterChain.doFilter(request, response);
}
```

---

## Step 4 â€“ Role-Based Authorization

Now that users are authenticated, I needed to **restrict certain routes** based on their roles.

For example:

```java
@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")
@GetMapping("/admin/dashboard")
public String dashboard() {
    return "Welcome to the admin dashboard!";
}
```

If a regular user tries to access it, Spring Security blocks them immediately. Clean and simple.

## What I Learned

- **JWTs are amazing** for stateless APIs. No session storage needed.
- **OAuth 2.0 concepts** (like access tokens, scopes, roles) can be overkill at first, but are powerful when scaling.
- **Spring Security** has a learning curve, but once configured, it does most of the heavy lifting for you.

---

## Final Thoughts

Authentication isnâ€™t just about "logging in"â€”itâ€™s about building trust into your system. With the right setup, your API can be secure, scalable, and easy to integrate with frontend clients or third-party apps.

---

## Whatâ€™s Next?

- Add **refresh tokens** so sessions can last longer
- Add **social logins** using OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- Integrate **API rate limiting** and **logging** for better observability

If youâ€™re building REST APIs and havenâ€™t implemented JWTs yet, I highly recommend giving it a shot. Itâ€™s one of those things that once you get working, feels incredibly satisfying.
