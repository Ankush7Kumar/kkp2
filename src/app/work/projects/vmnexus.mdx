## Overview

Engineered VM Nexus, a Dockerized full-stack application designed to streamline virtual machine (VM) management. The platform combines Django for backend APIs and ReactJS for a dynamic frontend interface, enabling efficient VM configuration and monitoring.

## Key Features

- **Dockerized Architecture**: Fully containerized application using Docker Compose to orchestrate frontend, backend, and database services.
- **REST API Integration**: Built RESTful endpoints in Django to support real-time CRUD operations for managing VM records.
- **Secure SSH Management**: Incorporated SSH key fields and validation for secure VM access, enhancing deployment security.
- **Seamless UI/UX**: Developed a responsive ReactJS frontend with Webpack for module bundling and smooth frontend-backend communication.

## Technologies Used

- **Django**: Backend framework for robust API development and admin interface.
- **ReactJS**: Frontend library for building responsive and interactive UIs.
- **Docker**: For containerizing and managing the full-stack environment.
- **Webpack**: Used for frontend bundling and asset optimization.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database used for storing VM data securely.

## Challenges and Learnings

A key challenge was ensuring secure transmission and handling of SSH credentials. Implemented encrypted fields and server-side validation to mitigate security risks. Learned best practices for orchestrating multi-container apps with Docker and improving build pipelines with Webpack.

## Outcome

VM Nexus is now used to manage and monitor virtual machines in a secure, scalable, and user-friendly manner. It has simplified operations for teams by centralizing VM configurations and reducing manual setup efforts.
