## Overview

VirtualHaus is a smart home management Android application built using Kotlin and the MVVM architecture. It enables users to organize and manage various aspects of their shared or personal living space through an intuitive, real-time interface powered by Firebase Realtime Database.

## Key Features

- **Room and Item Management**: Users can digitally create a house, add rooms like kitchens, and track items stored inside.
- **Event Scheduling**: Integrated calendar to add and view future events or important dates relevant to household members.
- **Expense and Laundry Tracking**: Track shared expenses and check laundry machine availability in real-time.
- **Quiet Time Booking**: Feature to reserve quiet hours in the house, ideal for focused work or study sessions.

## Technologies Used

- **Kotlin**: For building modern, efficient Android applications.
- **MVVM Architecture**: Ensures a scalable and maintainable codebase with separation of concerns.
- **Firebase Realtime Database**: Provides real-time updates across all app clients using the client-server model.
- **Android Jetpack Components**: Leveraged for lifecycle-aware, reactive programming and UI binding.

## Challenges and Learnings

Implementing real-time data synchronization without UI lag required careful handling of LiveData and Firebase listeners. Learned to optimize performance with offline caching and clean state management using MVVM principles. Balancing feature-richness with usability was a key design consideration.

## Outcome

VirtualHaus has streamlined household coordination by centralizing tasks like inventory, scheduling, and shared responsibilities in one app. The solution supports multiple users and has laid the groundwork for future expansion into smart home integrations.
